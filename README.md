# SampleCode
The updated test:

Description:
I want to analyze my Company data so that I can take advantage of this info and make more money for my company (this is a highly competitive sector). We would like to build a Mobile native app, either for Android or for iOS, that displays the answers for the following details.

Details:
Retrieve the customer with the earliest check in date.
Retrieve the customer with the latest check in date.
Retrieve a list of customer’s full names ordered alphabetically.
Retrieve a list of the companies user’s jobs ordered alphabetically.

Functional notes:
The full name of our customers is composed by First Name and Last Name.

Technical notes:
The app must retrieve the data from the following URL https://19h0vwjnce.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/MobileInternshipAPI/data , taking into account that the data list could contain more elements in the future (therefore, the app should not relay on how many elements has the file).
The assignment has to be coded either on Kotlin or on Swift.

We would need you to resolve this task in a public GitHub repository of your own so that we can access it.
